### Documents

All my documents that I use to apply for different roles will be available here.

As you will see I have resumes for both Software Engineer and Product Designer 

role- true enough; I have been involved in both roles and have put both hats on in my 

5 years of development experience. So don't be confused!

I tried to maintain standards while compiling the resumes and cover letters and other

documents that will be available here- have taken feedbacks from trustworthy 

and eligible people- so you can definitely use any of the documents as a template 

for compiling yours.

If you use any of them- and it brings you any luck or success in your career hunt- I will

be more than happy to hear about it.
